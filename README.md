# Car Haptic Feedback Simulator

Reads value of pressure applied on force resistive sensor and applies moving average. Detects short or long press and delivers haptic feedback through linear resonent actuator.

Used to integrate force sensor in car steering wheel to explore new means of interacting with car entertainment systems.

For 2021 Imperial HCDE Design Engineering project
